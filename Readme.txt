Purpose of software:
	Reads unsigned numbers from binary files, and determines which numbers are prime. This assignment has different parts
	based around prime numbers, and each program has it's own functionality.
	
The learning purpose:
	Process spawning, and differentiating between parent and child processes,
	Usage of signals and function pointers.
	Inter-process communication.
	Program morphing.

Software Organization:
	- createBinary.c
	- isPrime.c, isPrime.o
	- singlePrime.c, singlePrime.o
	- singleSpawn.c, singleSpawn.o
	- multiSpawn.c, multiSpawn.o
	- bonus1.c, bonus1.o
	- multiSpawnSignal.c (not complete)
	- Makefile0, Makefile1, Makefile2, Makefile3, Makefilebonussection, Makefile4
	- prime.bin
	- prime.txt

Compilation Instructions:
				
	isPrime.c:
		Compilation:
			make -f Makefile0
		To run program:
			./isPrime (followed by a number of your choice)

	Task 1:
		Compilation: 
			make -f Makefile1
		To run program:
			./singleMorph prime.bin

	Task 2:
		Compilation: 
			make -f Makefile2
		To run program
			./singleSpawn prime.bin

	Task 3:
		Compilation:  
			make -f Makefile3
		To run program
			./multiSpawn prime.bin

	Bonus Section (Task 3):
		Compilation: 
			make -f Makefilebonussection
		To run program
			./bonus1 prime.bin
	Bonus Task 4:
		//not complete, no need to compile as of today


Issues:
	- No known issues
Notes:
	- Be paitent while spawning multiple children, time varies by system. (It may be slower on school computers.)
	- Since this a step by step program, Makefile0 must be compiled (isPrime executable required)
	- Bonus Task 4 is not complete as of now

Usage Instructions:		
	- Compile and run each program with the file you would like to read. In this case, prime.bin is the provided file.
